# 2023-ASA-Data-Fest-Challenge 
2023 ASA DataFest features a data set provided by theAmerican Bar Association (ABA) and this is the largest professional membership organization for lawyers. The data comes from a online platform called ABA Free Legal Answers, which is an outreach by the ABA to provide free legal advice to individuals who cannot afford the services of a lawyer.

We have been provided with several data sets that provide:

Information about the clients\
▶ What states and counties they are from\
▶ Demographics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, annual income)

▶ When they log on to the site to ask questions

Information about the lawyers

▶ What lawyers volunteer to answer questions

▶ What states and counties they are from

▶ When they log on to the site to answer questions

Text of the questions asked by the clients, and answers they received from the lawyers.

The challenge is to provide insights about the following questions:
1. Who tends to use the site?
2. What questions do they tend to ask?
3. When do they ask the different types of questions?
